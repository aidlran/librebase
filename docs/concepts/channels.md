# Channels

Channels bridge the engine with the outside world. They can serve multiple purposes like:

- Providing an interface used by the engine to request data from or push data to a source like a cache, a file, an API, or another peer.
- Receiving realtime updates and pushing them into the engine.
- Providing developers with reactive APIs for application development.
