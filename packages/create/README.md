# create-librebase

The Librebase app scaffolding tool. Currently a work in progress.

## Goals

- Make it easy to jump right into the action of building apps without having to read the boring "getting started" bit of the documentation.

- Able to configure for browser or server environments and automatically integrate with popular frameworks.

- Able to scaffold a new project and piggyback off of popular framework scaffolding tools.

## Usage

```sh
npm create librebase
```
