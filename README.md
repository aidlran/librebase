## Stability

This project is currently in a pre-release state as indicated by the `<1.0.0` version number. During this time, updates are more likely to be unstable with undocumented breaking changes. These breaking changes will be kept to the **minor** version number (i.e. the `x` of `v0.x.y`) as much as possible.

Deprecation warnings will often be added prior to breaking changes. These are visible with a ~~strikethrough~~ effect in most code editors. You could also use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) with a [deprecation plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-deprecation) to help automatically identify needed updates before upgrading.
