# [Librebase](https://librebase.io)

Librebase is an open-source, extensible suite of protocols for building multi-user, decentralized apps. As an app developer, you might think of it as an open source, decentralized Firebase - but with cryptographic, mathematical certainties being the source of truth rather than a faceless entity like Google. Librebase takes a "don't trust, verify" approach, where all users are empowered to validate data for themselves while maintaining the same, or much better, privacy and security than you'd expect from a traditional approach to application development

## Why?

The Librebase approach offers many benefits:

- Apps are offline first by default and can work without a need for a constant connection to the cloud. You can even continue to collaborate in realtime with peers on the same local network while the internet connection is down.

- Support for self hosting. Librebase is open source software, so you can always spin up relays on your own infrastructure.

- Decentralized and peer-to-peer. No more centralized points of failure. No more sleepless nights worrying about the primary db in us-west-1.

- Unlimited data sources. Anything can be a driver - from local storage to remote SQL databases to APIs and even other peers. Run multiple drivers at a time and swap at a whim.

- Incremental adoption friendly - no need to commit to a huge rewrite when data models, backends, & network architecture can be incrementally updated.

- Control your own identity and keys, use them across multiple apps anonymously. Spawn multiple identities from one seed.

- No infrastructure needed - users can even bring their own storage providers.

- Support for SSO, cloud storage, other enterprise blockers provided.

- First class developer experience.
